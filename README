A very simple MATLAB/GNU Octave "toolbox" for numerical continuous simulation.
The library was developed in GNU Octave, however every effort was made to
preserve compatibility with MATLAB.

Several integration numerical methods are included. For the complete list, see the wiki:
https://github.com/jkovacic/cont-sim/wiki/Implemented-methods
More numerical methods may be included in the future.

Additionally an example mathematical model of a pendulum on a movable support (defined at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics#Pendulum_on_a_movable_support)
is included, it is implemented in model_movable_output.m and output_movable_pendulum.m.

For more information, see the project's wiki (https://github.com/jkovacic/cont-sim/wiki), 
the demo script main.m and comments in individual files.
