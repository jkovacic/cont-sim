A Matlab and GNU Octave library for numerical continuous simulation.

Two implementations with exactly the same functionality are currently available, 
each one in a separate directory:
- octave: procedural implementation, tested on Matlab (incl. older versions) and GNU Octave
- matlab: object oriented implementation, designed exclusively for newer versions of Matlab

Several integration numerical methods are included. For the complete list, see the wiki:
https://github.com/jkovacic/cont-sim/wiki/Implemented-methods
More numerical methods may be included in the future.

Additionally an example mathematical model of a pendulum on a movable support (defined at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics#Pendulum_on_a_movable_support)
is included, it is implemented in model_deriv_movable_output.m and 
model_output_movable_pendulum.m (procedural implementation) and MovablePendulum.m
(object oriented implementation).

For more information, see the project's wiki (https://github.com/jkovacic/cont-sim/wiki), 
demo scripts main.m in both directories and extensive comments in individual files.
