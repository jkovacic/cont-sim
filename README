A very simple MATLAB/GNU Octave "toolbox" for numerical continuous simulation.
The library was developed in GNU Octave, however every effort was made to
preserve compatibility with MATLAB.

The packet includes the two most common integration methods: the Euler method 
(implemented in integ_euler.m) and the 4th order Runge-Kutta method (implemented
in integ_rk4.m). More numerical methods may be included in the future.

Additionally an example mathematical model of a pendulum on a movable support (defined at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics#Pendulum_on_a_movable_support)
is included, it is implemented in model_movable_output.m and output_movable_pendulum.m.

For more information, see instructions in the wiki, the demo script main.m
and comments in individual files.
